Day-Planner

This app runs on the browser to presents the user a simple calendar application. That allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 

The UI is dynamically updated with Javascript to bring forth the required changes to the HTML and CSS powered by JQuery to create an interactive user experience.

The COVID19 pandemic aside, as I tend to juggle a busy schedule, I wanted the user of this app to add important events to the daily planner. So they can manage their time more effectively.

Third Party API's used were Momement.js (https://momentjs.com/),  and Bootstrap(https://getbootstrap.com/).
